    <h1>About This Website</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my website. I have created this website because of
        my love of astronomy and astrophotography and I want to share
        many of the images that I have taken through my telescopes. I
        created this site because I love the hobby of star-gazing and
        astrophotography and I like to share it with others.

    <h2>Telescopes</h2>
    <p>
        Whenever you view the details of an image, you will see listed
        in the details the telescope that was used to take the image.
        Here are all the telescopes that I have in my collection.
